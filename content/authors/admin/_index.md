Welcome! I am a Research Scientist at the [Bruno Kessler Foundation (FBK)](https://www.fbk.eu/en/), Trento, Italy. My work focuses on computer vision, unsupervised learning, and human behavioural understanding through multi-modal data. This includes modelling human mobility and perception, photorealistic object manipulation and animation, video synthesis and image-to-image translation. My work has been published in multiple top conference papers and journals.

I collaborated with numerous international institutions including MIT, MIT Media Lab, Nokia Bell Labs, Vodafone Group and Data-pop Alliance. Before joining FBK, I was a research intern at Vodafone, London, UK, and worked with Angelo Cardoso and [Nuria Oliver](https://www.nuriaoliver.com/). I also visted the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and worked with [Marta C. Gonzalez](https://ced.berkeley.edu/ced/faculty-staff/marta-gonzalez) and [Cesar Hidalgo](https://cesarhidalgo.com/).

I am a PhD graduate from the University of Trento, Italy, where I worked with [Bruno Lepri](https://scholar.google.it/citations?user=JfcopG0AAAAJ&hl=en), at the Mobs Lab, and [Nicu Sebe](http://disi.unitn.it/~sebe/) at the Multimedia and Human Understanding Group [MHUG](http://mhug.disi.unitn.it/). Before joining the MHUG group.
