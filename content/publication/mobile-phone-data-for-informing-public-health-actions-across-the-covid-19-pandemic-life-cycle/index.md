abstract: The coronavirus 2019–2020 pandemic (COVID-19) poses unprecedented
  challenges for governments and societies around the world. Non-pharmaceutical
  interventions have proven to be critical for delaying and containing the
  COVID-19 pandemic. These include testing and tracing, bans on large
  gatherings, nonessential business and school and university closures,
  international and domestic mobility restrictions and physical isolation, and
  total lockdowns of regions and countries. Decision-making and evaluation or
  such interventions during all stages of the pandemic life cycle require
  specific, reliable, and timely data not only about infections but also about
  human behavior, especially mobility and physical co-presence. We argue that
  mobile phone data, when used properly and carefully, represents a critical
  arsenal of tools for supporting public health actions across early, middle,
  and late stage phases of the COVID-19 pandemic.
