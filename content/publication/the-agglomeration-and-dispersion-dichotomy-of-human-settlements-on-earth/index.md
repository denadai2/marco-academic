abstract: "Human settlements on Earth are scattered in a multitude of shapes,
  sizes and spatial arrangements. These patterns are often not random but a
  result of complex geographical, cultural, economic and historical processes
  that have profound human and ecological impacts. However, little is known
  about the global distribution of these patterns and the spatial forces that
  creates them. This study analyses human settlements from high-resolution
  satellite imagery and provides a global classification of spatial patterns. We
  find two emerging classes, namely agglomeration and dispersion. In the former,
  settlements are fewer than expected based on the predictions of scaling
  theory, while an unexpectedly high number of settlements characterizes the
  latter. Our global classification of spatial patterns correlates with some
  urban outcomes, such as the amount of CO2 emitted for transportation,
  providing insights into the relationship between land use patterns and
  socio-economic and environmental indicators. To explain the observed spatial
  patterns, we also propose a model that combines two agglomeration forces and
  simulates human settlements' historical growth. Our results show that our
  model accurately matches the observed global classification (F1: 0.73), helps
  to understand and estimate the growth of human settlements and, in turn, the
  distribution and physical dynamics of all human settlements on Earth, from
  small villages to cities. "
