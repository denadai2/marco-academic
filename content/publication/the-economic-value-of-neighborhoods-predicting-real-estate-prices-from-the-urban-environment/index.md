abstract: Housing costs have a significant impact on individuals, families,
  businesses, and governments. Recently, online companies such as Zillow have
  developed proprietary systems that provide automated estimates of housing
  prices without the immediate need of professional appraisers. Yet, our
  understanding of what drives the value of houses is very limited. In this
  paper, we use multiple sources of data to entangle the economic contribution
  of the neighborhood's characteristics such as walkability and security
  perception. We also develop and release a framework able to now-cast housing
  prices from Open data, without the need for historical transactions.
  Experiments involving 70,000 houses in 8 Italian cities highlight that the
  neighborhood's vitality and walkability seem to drive more than 20% of the
  housing value. Moreover, the use of this information improves the nowcast by
  60%. Hence, the use of property's surroundings' characteristics can be an
  invaluable resource to appraise the economic and social value of houses after
  neighborhood changes and, potentially, anticipate gentrification.
