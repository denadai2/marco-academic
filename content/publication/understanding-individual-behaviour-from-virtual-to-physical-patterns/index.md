abstract: "As \"Big Data\" has become pervasive, an increasing amount of
  research has connected the dots between human behaviour in the offline and
  online worlds. Consequently, researchers have exploited these new findings to
  create models that better predict different aspects of human life and
  recommend future behaviour. To date, however, we do not yet fully understand
  the similarities and differences of human behaviour in these virtual and
  physical worlds. Here, we analyse and discuss the mobility and application
  usage of 400,000 individuals over eight months. We find an astonishing
  similarity between people's mobility in the physical space and how they move
  from app to app in smartphones. Our data shows that individuals use and visit
  a finite number of apps and places, but they keep exploring over time. In
  particular, two distinct profiles of individuals emerge: those that keep
  changing places and services, and those that are stable over time, named as
  \"explorers\" and \"keepers\". We see these findings as crucial to enrich a
  discussion for the potentials and the challenges of building human-centric AI
  systems, which might leverage recent results in Computational Social Science.
