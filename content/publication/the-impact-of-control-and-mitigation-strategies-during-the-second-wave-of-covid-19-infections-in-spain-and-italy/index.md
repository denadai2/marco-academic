abstract: "European countries struggled to fight against the second and the
  third waves of the COVID-19 pandemic, as the Test-Trace-Isolate (TTI) strategy
  widely adopted over the summer and early fall failed to effectively contain
  the spread of the disease. In this paper, we shed light on the effectiveness
  of such a strategy in two European countries (Spain and Italy) by analysing
  data from June to December 2020, collected via a large-scale online citizen
  survey with 95,251 answers in Spain and 43,393 answers in Italy. Through our
  analysis, we identify several weaknesses in each of the three pillars of the
  TTI strategy: testing, tracing and isolating. Moreover, we analyse the
  respondents’ self-reported behaviour before and after the mitigation
  strategies were deployed during the second wave of infections. We find that
  the changes in the participants’ behaviour were more pronounced in Italy than
  in Spain, whereas in both countries, respondents reported being very compliant
  with individual protection measures, such as wearing facial masks or
  frequently disinfecting their hands. Finally, we analyse the participants’
  perceptions about their government’s measures and the safety of everyday
  activities and places regarding the risk of getting an infection. We find that
  the perceived risk is often gender- and age-dependent and not aligned with the
  risk level identified by the literature. This finding emphasises the
  importance of deploying public-health communication campaigns to debunk
  misconceptions about SARS-CoV-2. Overall, our work shows the value of online
  citizen surveys to quickly and cheaply collect large-scale data to support and
  evaluate policy decisions to contrast the spread of the disease."
