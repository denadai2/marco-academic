abstract: "Cognition has been found to constrain several aspects of human
  behaviour, such as the number of friends and the number of favourite places a
  person keeps stable over time. This limitation has been empirically defined in
  the physical and social spaces. But do people exhibit similar constraints in
  the digital space? We address this question through the analysis of
  pseudonymised mobility and mobile application (app) usage data of 400,000
  individuals in a European country for six months. Despite the enormous
  heterogeneity of apps usage, we find that individuals exhibit a conserved
  capacity that limits the number of applications they regularly use. Moreover,
  we find that this capacity steadily decreases with age, as does the capacity
  in the physical space but with more complex dynamics. Even though people might
  have the same capacity, applications get added and removed over time. In this
  respect, we identify two profiles of individuals: app keepers and explorers,
  which differ in their stable (keepers) vs exploratory (explorers) behaviour
  regarding their use of mobile applications. Finally, we show that the capacity
  of applications predicts mobility capacity and vice-versa. By contrast, the
  behaviour of keepers and explorers may considerably vary across the two
  domains. Our empirical findings provide an intriguing picture linking human
  behaviour in the physical and digital worlds which bridges research studies
  from Computer Science, Social Physics and Computational Social Sciences."
