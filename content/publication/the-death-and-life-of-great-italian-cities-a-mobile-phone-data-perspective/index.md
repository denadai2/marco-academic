abstract: The Death and Life of Great American Cities was written in 1961 and is
  now one of the most influential book in city planning. In it, Jane Jacobs
  proposed four conditions that promote life in a city. However, these
  conditions have not been empirically tested until recently. This is mainly
  because it is hard to collect data about" city life". The city of Seoul
  recently collected pedestrian activity through surveys at an unprecedented
  scale, with an effort spanning more than a decade, allowing researchers to
  conduct the first study successfully testing Jacobs's conditions.
