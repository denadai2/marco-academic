abstract: "Image-to-Image (I2I) multi-domain translation models are usually
  evaluated also using the quality of their semantic interpolation results.
  However, state-of-the-art models frequently show abrupt changes in the image
  appearance during interpolation, and usually perform poorly in interpolations
  across domains. In this paper, we propose a new training protocol based on
  three specific losses which help a translation network to learn a smooth and
  disentangled latent style space in which: 1) Both intra- and inter-domain
  interpolations correspond to gradual changes in the generated images and 2)
  The content of the source image is better preserved during the translation.
  Moreover, we propose a novel evaluation metric to properly measure the
  smoothness of latent style space of I2I translation models. The proposed
  method can be plugged into existing translation approaches, and our extensive
  experiments on different datasets show that it can significantly boost the
  quality of the generated images and the graduality of the interpolations. "
