abstract: "Policy makers, urban planners, architects, sociologists, and
  economists are interested in creating urban areas that are both lively and
  safe. But are the safety and liveliness of neighborhoods independent
  characteristics? Or are they just two sides of the same coin? In a world where
  people avoid unsafe looking places, neighborhoods that look unsafe will be
  less lively, and will fail to harness the natural surveillance of human
  activity. But in a world where the preference for safe looking neighborhoods
  is small, the connection between the perception of safety and liveliness will
  be either weak or nonexistent. In this paper we explore the connection between
  the levels of activity and the perception of safety of neighborhoods in two
  major Italian cities by combining mobile phone data (as a proxy for activity
  or liveliness) with scores of perceived safety estimated using a Convolutional
  Neural Network trained on a dataset of Google Street View images scored using
  a crowdsourced visual perception survey. We find that: (i) safer looking
  neighborhoods are more active than what is expected from their population
  density, employee density, and distance to the city centre; and (ii) that the
  correlation between appearance of safety and activity is positive, strong, and
  significant, for females and people over 50, but negative for people under 30,
  suggesting that the behavioral impact of perception depends on the demographic
  of the population. Finally, we use occlusion techniques to identify the urban
  features that contribute to the appearance of safety, finding that greenery
  and street facing windows contribute to a positive appearance of safety (in
  agreement with Oscar Newman's defensible space theory). These results suggest
  that urban appearance modulates levels of human activity and, consequently, a
  neighborhood's rate of natural surveillance."
